This project is an interactive visualization tool that demonstrates a random walk on an n-dimensional hypercube.  

Core Concept: It simulates and visualizes how a point moves randomly through the vertices of a hypercube, which is a higher-dimensional analog of a cube.
Key Features:

Adjustable dimensions (from 2 up to 20)
Real-time graphical representations of the walk's properties
Statistical analysis of the walk's behavior


Main Visualizations:

Distribution of the number of 1s in the current state
Distribution of visited states
How the walk's properties converge towards theoretical distributions over time
Average and current state values as the walk progresses


Educational Value: It demonstrates important concepts in probability theory, such as:

-How high-dimensional random walks behave
-The emergence of normal distributions (due to the Central Limit Theorem)
-Convergence to uniform distributions in state space


Interactive Elements: Users can start, stop, reset, and adjust the speed of the simulation, allowing for exploration of how different parameters affect the walk's behavior.
Technical Implementation: It's a web-based application using HTML, JavaScript, and the Chart.js library for visualizations.
